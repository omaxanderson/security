I want to learn more about security, so here's my gameplan to do so. This will certainly be edited as time goes on.

1. Learn a little bit about ciphers, code them up, and then break them.
	- Caesar cipher, Affine, substitution, Vigenere, Playfiar, Hill
2. Learn about more modern encryption.
	- DES and Triple DES
	- AES (Rijndael cipher)
	- public key cryptography

3. Read the OWASP guidlines and learn common real-world vulnerabilities

4. HackThisSite which can offer exercises

5. Take part in CTF competitions
